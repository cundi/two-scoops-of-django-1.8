28 | Signals:Use Cases and Avoidance Techniques
第二十八章：信号的使用案例和规避技术
**************************

**The Short Answer**:   
**简而言之**：  

Use signals as a last resort.  

**The Long Answer**: 
**长篇大论**：
    
Often when new Djangonauts first discover signals,they get signal-happy. They
start sprinkling signals everywhere they can and feeling like real experts at Django.  

通常，Django新手在第一次发现信号——他们觉得很开心。他们开始把信号尽可能地用到所有地方，而且他们觉得自己的行为像个Django方面的专家。  

After coding this way for a while, projects start to turn into confusing, knotted hairballs that can’t be untangled. Signals are being dispatched everywhere and hopefully getting received somewhere, but at that point it’s hard to tell what exactly is going on.  

当他们这么做了一段时间之后，项目会变得一团糟，你要知道一旦毛线打结成团是很难解开的。信号被派遣得到处都是，同时希望在某处可以接受它，不过在那个时候谁也讲不清楚到底发生了什么事情。  

Many developers also confuse signals with asynchronous message queues such as what Celery (http://www.celeryproject.org/) provides. Make no mistake, signals are synchronous and blocking, and calling performance-heavy processes via signals provides absolutely no benefit from a performance or scaling perspective. In fact, moving such processes unnecessarily to signals is considered code obfuscation.  

很多开发者也对信号和Celery提供的异步消息队列感到困惑。如果，我没记错的话，信号是异步而且阻塞的，通过信号来调用高耗能的进程，站在性能或者扩展角度来看毫无任何好处。实际上，将这类进程放到信号里传送根本没有必要，被认为代码混淆。  

Signals can be useful, but they should be used as a last resort, only when there’s no good way to avoid using them.  

信号虽然很好用，但是它们应该作为保留手段来使用，只能在没什么好办法，无可避免时使用它们。  

## 28.1 When to Use and Avoid Signals 使用信号的合适时机
Do not use signals when:  
当出现以下情况时不要使用信号：  

- The signal relates to one particular model and can be moved into one of that model’s methods, possibly called by save().  
- The signal can be replaced with a custom model manager method.  
- The signal relates to a particular view and can be moved into that view.  

- 关联到特殊模型的信号可以迁移到模型的其中一个方法，
- 信号可以使用自定义的模型管理器方法来替换。  
- 关联到特殊视图的信号可以移动该视图。  

It might be okay to use signals when:  
当出现以下情况时使用信号是没问题的：  

- Your signal receiver needs to make changes to more than one model.  
- You want to dispatch the same signal from multiple apps and have them handled the same way
by a common receiver.  
- You want to invalidate a cache after a model save.  
- You have an unusual scenario that needs a callback, and there’s no other way to handle it besides
using a signal. For example, you want to trigger something based on the save() or init() of a third-party app’s model. You can’t modify the third-party code and extending it might be impossible, so a signal provides a trigger for a callback.  

- 信号接收器需要对不止一个模型应用变更。  
- 你想要从多个应用发送相同的信号，而且由一个公共接收器按照同样的方法来处理。  
- 你想要在模型保存后是缓存失效。  


>### TIP: Aymeric Augustin Thoughts on Signals
>Django core developer Aymeric Augustin says: “I advise not to use signals as soon as a regular function call will do. Signals obfuscate control  ow through inversion of control.  ey make it difficult to discover what code will actually run.  
>Use a signal only if the piece of code sending it has positively no way to determine what its receivers will be.”  

## 28.2 Signal Avoidance Techniques 信号的规避技术
Let’s go over some scenarios where you can simplify your code and remove some of the signals that you don’t need.  

让我们来通过几个可以简化代码的场景，

### 28.2.1 Using Custom Model Manager Methods Instead of Signals 使用自定义模型管理器来替换信号
Let’s imagine that our site handles user-submitted ice cream-themed events, and each ice cream event goes through an approval process.  ese events are set with a status of “Unreviewed” upon creation. The problem is that we want our site administrators to get an email for each event submission so they know to review and post things quickly.  

We could have done this with a signal, but unless we put in extra logic in the post save() code, even administrator created events would generate emails.  

An easier way to handle this use case is to create a custom model manager method and use that in your views.  is way, if an event is created by an administrator, they don’t have to go through the review process.  

Since a code example is worth a thousand words, here is how we would create such a method:  

Example 28.1  

```python
# events/managers.py
from django.db import models


class EventManager(models.Manager):

    def create_event(self, title, start, end, creator):
        event = self.model(title=title,
                            start=start,
                            end=end,
                            creator=creator)
        event.save()
        event.notify_admins()
        return event
```

Now that we have our custom manager with its custom manager method in place, let’s attach it to our model (which comes with a `notify admins()` method:  

Example 28.2  

```python
# events/models.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.mail import mail_admins 
from django.db import models

from model_utils.models import TimeStampedModel

from .managers import EventManager


class Event(TimeStampedModel):

    STATUS_UNREVIEWED, STATUS_REVIEWED = (0, 1)
    STATUS_CHOICES = (
        (STATUS_UNREVIEWED, "Unreviewed"),
        (STATUS_REVIEWED, "Reviewed"),
    )

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    start = models.DateTimeField()
    end = models.DateTimeField()
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS_CHOICES,
                                    default=STATUS_UNREVIEWED)
    creator = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)

    objects = EventManager()

    def notify_admins(self):
        # create the subject and message
        subject = "{user} submitted a new event!".format(
                        user=self.creator.get_full_name())
        message = """TITLE: {title} START: {start} END: {end}""".format(title=self.title, start=self.start, end=self.end)

        # Send to the admins!
        mail_admins(subject=subject,
              message=message,
              fail_silently=False)
```

Using this follows a similar pattern to using the User model. To generate an event, instead of calling `create()`, we call a `create event()` method.  

Example 28.3  

```shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> from events.models import Event
>>> user = get_user_model().get(username="audreyr")
>>> now = timezone.now()
>>> event = Event.objects.create_event(
...     title="International Ice Cream Tasting Competition",
...     start=now,
...     end=now,
...     user=user
...     )
```


### 28.2.2 Validate Your Model Else where
If you’re using a `pre_save` signal to trigger input cleanup for a specific model, try writing a custom validator for your field(s) instead.  

If validating through a `ModelForm`, try overriding your model’s `clean()` method instead.  

### 28.2.3 Override Your Model's Save or Delete Method Instead
If you’re using `pre_save` and `post_save` signals to trigger logic that only applies to one particular model, you might not need those signals. You can often simply move the signal logic into your model’s `save()` method.  

如果你正在使用信号`pre_save` 和 `post_save`去触发只应用在一个特殊模型的逻辑，那么你就不需要使用这些信号。你可以

The same applies to overriding `delete()` instead of using `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals.  

### 28.2.4 Use a Helper Function Instead of Signals
We find this approach useful under two conditions:  

我们发现这个方法再下面两种条件下非常有用：  

1. *Refactoring*: Once we realize that certain bits of code no longer need to be obfuscated as signals and want to refactor, the question of ‘Where do we put the code that was in a signal?’ arises. If it doesn’t belong in a model manager, custom validator, or overloaded model method, where does it belong?  

*重构*：当我们认识到一部分代码在使用信号变的令人困惑，而且我们想要重构，那么问题来了，“我们需要将哪些代码放进信号中呢？”。如果这部分代码不属于模型管理器或者自定义的验证器或者重写的模型方法，那么它到底属于什么地方呢？  

2. *Architecture*: Sometimes developers use signals because we feel the model has become too heavyweight and we need a place for code. While Fat Models are a nice approach, we ad- mit it’s not much fun to have to parse through a 500 or 2000 line chunk of code.  

*架构*：有时候开发者使用信号，是因为我们感觉模型太重了，我们需要给代码准备一个地方。  

This solution, suggested to us by Django core developer Aymeric Augustin, is to place the code in helper functions. If done right, this helps us write cleaner, more reusable code.  

One interesting thing about this approach is to test the transition out of signals. Simply follow these steps:  

    1. Write a test for the existing signal call.

    2. Write a test for the business logic of the existing signal call as if it were in a separate function.
 
    3. Write a helper function that duplicates the business logic of the signal, matching the assertions of the test written in the second step.
 
    4. Run the tests.
 
    5. Call the helper function from the signal.
    
    6. Run the tests again.
 
    7. Remove the signal and call the helper function from the appropriate location.
 
    8. Run the tests again.

    9. Rinse and repeat until done.

This approach allows us to carefully remove the signal without breaking things. It also helps us iden-
tify when an existing signal is required for a specific process.  

## 28.3 Summary
Signals are a powerful tool in any Django developer’s toolbox. However, they are easy to misuse and it’s good practice to delve into why and when to use them.
